"    FIVE OLD UYGHUR ABHIDHARMA TEXTS CONTAINING                   BRĀHMĪ ELEMENTS*                                    YUKIYO KASAI                                         Abstract  It is commonly known that Chinese Buddhist texts were the main source of Old Uyghur Buddhist texts, which means that the majority of them were translated from Chinese. Among them were not only popular Mahāyāna texts but also Chinese apocryphal texts and commentaries. Abhidharma texts were also included in the lists of texts translated from Chinese. These works are noteworthy for the fact that they often contain Chinese characters in them. However, in recent years five Abhidharma texts partly written in Brāhmī script have been identified. In this paper, the comparative study of those five texts as well as their possible originals is presented, and related problems are discussed.                                     1. Introduction  After the introduction of Buddhism to the Uyghur people under the West Uyghur Kingdom (second half 9th to 13th century) and until the end of the Mongolian period in the 14th century, Buddhism was the main religion of the majority of Uyghurs. With their conversion to Buddhism the Uyghurs began to produce numerous Buddhist texts, most of which were written in their own language and in their own script. Although some of those texts seem to be original compositions in Old Uyghur, most of them were actually translated from other languages, such as Tocharian, Chinese or Tibetan. The Old Uyghur Buddhist texts, which we now have access to, represent only a small portion of what would have been produced, but they are deemed sufficient to document the rich diversity of Uyghur Buddhist literature. Not only well-known Mahāyāna sūtras but also commentaries and Abhidharma texts are found in the lists of the surviving Old Uyghur Buddhist texts.    The commentaries and Abhidharma texts indicate that some Uyghur monks were deeply engaged in the detailed study of the Buddhist teachings. This fact has already been pointed out by Kōgi Kudara, who notes that ―translation work and studies of the Abhidharma texts  BuddhistRoad Paper 1.1.

"   (10) Sanskrit and Old Uyghur bilingual                           text     of    the    Abhidharmakośabhāṣya in Brāhmī script8  Apart from the last text (10), most of them were probably copied during the Mongolian period, which we can infer from their use of Uyghur cursive script as well as the fact that some of them contain Chinese and Tibetan characters.    In addition, five more texts (see section 2) have been identified as Abhidharma texts recently in the Berlin Turfan Collection. The texts in question are partly written in Brāhmī script; however, their use of this script is limited to the Sanskrit terms, while the main text is in the Uyghur script. Moreover, they are all written in cursive script on the reverse of Chinese Buddhist manuscripts, so none of them have the appearance of having been produced as official versions such as those sponsored by donors or were meant for monastic libraries. Three of the five texts show a relationship with the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya. One is an Old Uyghur translation of the *Abhidharmahṛdayamiśraka, and the last one contains a discussion on the dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda, which indicates a strong similarity with the Abhidharmavibhāṣā. For all five texts, it is not clear which language they were translated from or what their authors took as the source of inspiration for their composition. Because Brāhmī script itself was probably borrowed by Uyghurs under Tocharian influence, it is assumed that those texts also show a close relationship to the Tocharian texts.9 At least two of them (texts in section   ____________    7      Kudara Kōgi 百済康義, ―Gojūni shinsho wo toku uiguruyaku abidaruma ronsho danpen 五十二心所を説くウイグル訳アビダルマ論書断片 [A Fragment of an Unknown Abhidharma Text in Uyghur],‖ Indogaku bukkyōgaku kenkyū 印度学仏教学研 究 [The Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies] 26.2 (1978): 1003–1000.    8      VOHD 13, 9, no. 14.    9      von Gabain, Annemarie, ―Die Schreiber der alt-türkischen Brāhmī-Texte,‖ Studia Orientalia 28.5 (1964): 6–7; Zieme, Peter, ―Zur Verwendung der Brāhmī-Schrift bei den Uiguren,‖ Altorientalische Forschungen 11.2 (1984): 337.

Five Old Uyghur Abhidharma Texts  2.1. An Old Uyghur Text Based on the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya Altogether, 31 fragments in the Berlin Turfan Collection belonging to the same manuscript are identified in the text based on the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya. They have been written on the reverse of the Chinese Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra (T. 220.5 and 6) and the Mahāratnakūṭasūtra (T. 310.11), and can be reconstructed to yield six large leaves on the basis of the exact identification and localisation of the Chinese texts on the front.10 These six leaves are from different chapters of the sūtras, and not all of them are in sequential order. Because the Uyghur cursive script is used here, this manuscript was probably copied during the Mongolian period (13th–14th century). 11 In the manuscript,  ____________    10        The complete edition of those fragments was published in my book, see BT XXXVIII, Text Aa, 29–55. The fragments which belong to this handwriting were listed in the table with the identification; see ibid., 30. Some fragments which originally belong to the same leaf were put together and the reconstructed images can be seen in BT ibid., Tafel I–V.     11        The different types of Uyghur script are used as one of the important features for dating of the Old Uyghur texts; see, e.g., Moriyasu Takao 森安孝夫, “Uigurugo bunken ウイグル語文献 [Uigurica from Dunhuang],‖ in Kōza Tonkō 6 Tonkō kogo bunken 講座 敦煌 6 敦煌胡語文献 [Dunhuang Series 6: Non-Chinese Literature from Dunhuang], ed.

Desmond Durkin-Meisterernst et al. (Berlin: Dietrich Reimer, 2004), 228–229. Most of the Old Uyghur texts do not have any date specification, so they cannot be dated exactly. Thus, the dating of those texts is a relevant and serious topic, and different features are still under discussion. As Moriyasu himself has underlined, the type of Uyghur script alone cannot give any definite dating of the texts per se.  BuddhistRoad Paper 1.1.

"every sheet of paper has a surface divided into two, with some space in the middle of the page kept free (e.g., see fig. 1). The text begins on the right, that is, in the second part of the sheet of paper, and continues into the first part towards the left. This way of writing the text allows us to assume that every piece of paper was folded in the middle, with the side with Chinese text being glued together. Then the leaves, completed in this way, had to be bound on the left side.12     Figure 1: Text based on the Abhidharmakośa-bhāsya. Turfan.

"   The comparison of this Old Uyghur text with the Abhidharmakośa- bhāṣya, as transmitted in other languages, makes it clear that the former has a close relationship with Xuanzang‘s (600/602–664, 玄奘) Chinese version (T. 1558.29). However, the Old Uyghur version is not a literal translation of the Chinese text. The most remarkable and serious differences between the two versions is the lack of the section in verse- form in the Uyghur text. The Abhidharmakośabhāṣya was originally composed by Vasubandhu (3rd–4th c. (?)) in accordance with the tenets of the Sarvāstivāda School. In this text, the composer first presents the teachings of this Buddhist school and then adds the corresponding commentary in prose. This style was also taken on by the Chinese translator Xuanzang, although he also reworked the original Sanskrit in many parts of the text. However, the Old Uyghur version, at least according to those leaves preserved up to now, only consists of the commentary without any presentations of the teachings to which the commentary added.    Brāhmī script has been used for a few single words in this text, but the choice of those words otherwise appears to have been made on the personal choice of the Uyghur translator (or rather, author). The Brāhmī script is typically used for Sanskrit proper names, but not all of them have been written in this script. In addition, some common nouns have been in Brāhmī, with their Sanskrit forms provided all the way through.13 The Chinese text which the Uyghur translator/author used as a reference cannot explain this arbitrary use in Old Uyghur texts. Thus, the choice of the words for Brāhmī use was surely left to the Uyghur translator/author to decide, and the Sanskrit forms used in this text reflect his level of knowledge. In this context, it is worth mentioning that in the text in question, only once do we encounter the number four being written in non-Uyghur script. Nevertheless, it differs remarkably from the otherwise commonly attested Brāhmī form (fig. 2).     ____________    13      This topic is discussed in detail, with several examples; see, Kasai, ―The Old Turkish text based on the Abhidharmakośa-bhāṣya,‖ 258–260.

This form is also attested in other Old Uyghur texts, one of which is identified as a kind of Abhidharma text. This form corresponds to the number four in Tibetan script.14 In that Abhidharma text, however, the Tibetan script is used only for numbers, whereas the whole text is otherwise written in Uyghur script. If the numbers in the text in question are Tibetan ones,15 three different scripts would then appear to have been used in one text. In which case, it remains unclear why the author/translator/scribe of this text used Tibetan only for numbers, or only for the number four, while using Uyghur and Brāhmī scripts for the text as a whole.   ____________    14       BT VII, 6; Shōgaito Masahiro 庄垣内正弘. ―Uigurubun ‗abidatsuma kusharon‘ chūshakusho no danpen niyō ウイグル文『阿毘達磨倶舎論』註釋書の斷片二葉 [The Uyghur Fragments of the ―Commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya‖],‖ in Philological Studies on Old Central Asian Manuscripts, ed.

"2.2. An Old Uyghur Version of Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (?) The fragment Ch/U 8014 [T III 1134] 16 written on the reverse of the Chinese translation of the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra (T. 1604.31) could be considered part of the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya. This fragment contains a list of ten different methods of obtaining the vinaya precepts (Skt. prātimokṣa).17 The same list is included in many Abhidharma texts, including the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, as follows:18          1. through self-ordination [svayaṃbhūtvena], in the case of the Buddha         and the self-enlightened ones (pratyekabuddha);         2. through entry into the noble path (niyāmāvakrānti), in the case of the         five [bhikṣus], i.e., of Ājñātakauṇḍinya and of his companions;         3. through the calling out: ―Come, bhikṣu!‖ [ehibhikṣukayā] in the case         of Ājñāta;         4. by recognizing the Fortunate One as master, as in the case of         Mahākāśyapa;         5. by satisfying the Fortunate One through one‘s answers, as in the case         of Sodāyin;         6. by accepting the special obligation of monastics, as in the case of         Mahāprajāpatī;         7. by a messenger, as in the case of Dharmadinnā;         8. by an officiant who is the fifth, i.e., ordination before a Saṅgha of five         bhikṣus, as in frontier lands;         9. by [a chapter of] ten bhikṣus, as in Madhyadeśa;         10. by repeating three times the formula of refuge, as in the case of the         sixty, the Bhadravargas, who were ordained in group.  ____________     16        The image of this fragment is accessible in Digital Turfan Archive, accessed November, 2018. http://turfan.bbaw.de/dta/ch_u/images/chu8014versototal.jpg.     17        For the complete transcription and German translation of this fragment, see BT XXXVIII, Text Ab, 57–59.     18        de la Vallée Poussin, Louis, Abhidharmakośa-Bhāṣya of Vasuvandhu.
